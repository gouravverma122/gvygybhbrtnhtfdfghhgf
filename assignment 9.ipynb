    "Ans: The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD). For example: Absolute path: C:/users/admin/docs/stuff.txt. If my PWD is C:/users/admin/ , then the relative path to stuff.txt would be: docs/stuff.txt. Note, PWD + relative path = absolute path."
